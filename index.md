{: style="text-align: justify"}
Process Management (PM) is a multidisciplinary field that combines insights from operations management, computer science, 
and data science (cf. process mining). 
The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques is leading to the creation of a new generation of information systems that can "augment" PM, 
making them more autonomous, adaptive, intelligent, and self-optimizing. Such systems are recently referred to as AI-augmented BPM systems[^1] (ABPMS). 
These AI-empowered, trustworthy, and process-aware systems continuously reason and act on data within a set of constraints, 
with the goal of adapting and improving one or more processes according to various indicators. 
ABPMSs are the backbone necessary to realize the vision of the enterprise of the future, enabling organizations to gradually shift their process management, 
advancing along the six levels of autonomous process execution management[^2].
